# Math311-Linear-Algebra-Projects

This is a repository of projects for the Math 311 linear algebra course at winona state university.  It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts.

# Projects
1. Solve systems using Colab and Python

Using Google Co-Laboratory to introduce the idea of solving systems pf equations with code:
